### Added
- `GenesisEnv` — a `gymnasium.Env` over a Genesis scene, with an injected `SceneDriver` seam.
- `GenesisRobotDriver` — reference driver: load a URDF/MJCF/USD robot, map a normalised action to a
  chosen subset of joints, step physics, read a camera and joint state.
- `record_episodes` + `LeRobotDatasetSink` — record rollouts as a `LeRobotDataset` (v3 loop).
- `GenesisEnvConfig` — registers Genesis with LeRobot as `--env.type=genesis`.
